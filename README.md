##Winstreak: A Sports Trivia Game

##Project Description:
The purpose of this project was to work as a group to create an application using html, css, javascript, bootstrap, and APIs. 

#The goal of the game is to get to the end by selecting the team with the highest score between two given teams. If you lose, the game ends.

#How to play:
First, start by selecting which sport you want to play between the NHL (National Hockey League) and Premiere League (Soccer).
When prompted with the dropdown menu containing the year, the user selects which year they want to play the game, and then select Enter. 
When given two choices displayed by the team logo, choose which team you think scored the highest amount of points. If chosen correctly, it brings you to the next round.

#Features:
#The game keeps track of highest score by storing the data of correct selections made by the user. When the game ends, the user is prompted to input their initials and their score is then displayed.
